## A simple tool for linking responses from Google Forms together with the location as the identifier

Uses Firebase Firestore + Google Forms to combine data from two different sources.

If you want to use this code you'll need to edit the Definitions.js file to use your own form questions.

P.S. this code was written in a bit less than half a day with no previous experience of the Apps Script environment, so something will probably break. You've been warned!!
